    "Glossary of commonly used SQL commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "Background\n",
    "SQL, Structured Query Language, is a programming language designed to manage data stored in relational databases. SQL operates through simple, declarative statements. This keeps data accurate and secure, and it helps maintain the integrity of databases, regardless of size.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s an appendix of commonly used commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "Commands\n",
    "ALTER TABLE\n",
    "ALTER TABLE table_name \n",
    "ADD column_name datatype;\n",

    "SELECT column_name(s)\n",
    "FROM table_name\n",
    "WHERE column_1 = value_1\n",
    "  AND column_2 = value_2;\n",
    "AND is an operator that combines two conditions. Both conditions must be true for the row to be included in the result set.\n",
    "\n",
    "AS\n",
    "SELECT column_name AS 'Alias'\n",
    "FROM table_name;\n",
    "AS is a keyword in SQL that allows you to rename a column or table using an alias.\n",
    "\n",
    "AVG()\n",
    "SELECT AVG(column_name)\n",
    "FROM table_name;\n",

    "SELECT column_name(s)\n",
    "FROM table_name\n",
    "WHERE column_name BETWEEN value_1 AND value_2;\n",

    "    ELSE 'Result_3'\n",
    "  END\n",
    "FROM table_name;\n",
    "CASE statements are used to create different outputs (usually in the SELECT statement). It is SQL’s way of handling if-then logic.\n",

    "COUNT()\n",
    "SELECT COUNT(column_name)\n",
    "FROM table_name;\n",

    "CREATE TABLE\n",
    "CREATE TABLE table_name (\n",
    "  column_1 datatype, \n",
    "  column_2 datatype, \n",
    "  column_3 datatype\n",
    ");\n",

    "\n",
    "DELETE\n",
    "DELETE FROM table_name\n",
    "WHERE some_column = some_value;\n",

    "SELECT column_name, COUNT(*)\n",
    "FROM table_name\n",
    "GROUP BY column_name;\n",

    "SELECT column_name, COUNT(*)\n",
    "FROM table_name\n",
    "GROUP BY column_name\n",
    "HAVING COUNT(*) > value;\n",
    "HAVING was added to SQL because the WHERE keyword could not be used with aggregate functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "INNER JOIN\n",
    "SELECT column_name(s)\n",
    "FROM table_1\n",
    "JOIN table_2\n",
    "  ON table_1.column_name = table_2.column_name;\n",
    "An inner join will combine rows from different tables if the join condition is true.\n",

    "LEFT JOIN table_2\n",
    "  ON table_1.column_name = table_2.column_name;\n",
    "An outer join will combine rows from different tables even if the join condition is not met. Every row in the left table is returned in the result set, and if the join condition is not met, then NULL values are used to fill in the columns from the right table.\n",
    "\n",
    "ROUND()\n",
    "SELECT ROUND(column_name, integer)\n",
    "FROM table_name;\n",
